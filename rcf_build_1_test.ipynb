    "# Introduction\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Random Cut Forest (RCF) is an algorithm designed to detect anomalous data points within a dataset. Examples of when anomalies are important to detect include when website activity uncharactersitically spikes, when temperature data diverges from a periodic behavior, or when changes to public transit ridership reflect the occurrence of a special event.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use the SageMaker RCF algorithm to train an RCF model on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) NYC Taxi dataset which records the amount New York City taxi ridership over the course of six months. We will then use this model to predict anomalous events by emitting an “anomaly score” for each data point. The main goals of this notebook are,\n",
    "\n",
    "- to learn how to obtain, transform, and store data for use in Amazon SageMaker;\n",
    "\n",
    "- to create an AWS SageMaker training job on a data set to produce an RCF model,\n",
    "\n",
    "- use the RCF model to perform inference with an Amazon SageMaker endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are **NOT** goals of this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- deeply understand the RCF model,\n",
    "\n",
    "- understand how the Amazon SageMaker RCF algorithm works.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to know more please check out the SageMaker RCF Documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setup\n",
    "This notebook was tested in Amazon SageMaker Studio on a **ml.t3.medium** instance with Python 3 (Data Science) kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step is to setup our AWS credentials so that AWS SageMaker can store and access training data and model artifacts. We also need some data to inspect and to train upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select Amazon S3 Bucket\n",
    "We first need to specify the locations where the original data is stored and where we will store our training data and trained model artifacts. This is the only cell of this notebook that you will need to edit. In particular, we need the following data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- bucket - An S3 bucket accessible by this account.\n",
    "\n",
    "- prefix - The location in the bucket where this notebook’s input and output data will be stored. (The default value is sufficient.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- downloaded_data_bucket - An S3 bucket where data is downloaded from this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/numenta/NAB/master/data/realKnownCause/nyc_taxi.csv) and stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "- downloaded_data_prefix - The location in the bucket where the data is stored."
